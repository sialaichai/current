2. **⚪ White Power Pills** - Collect for +10 points
3. **💍 Rings** - Collect for temporary invulnerability (+100 points)
4. **🔥 Fireballs** - Avoid or destroy when invulnerable (+500 points)
5. **🚪 Doors** - Reach to complete levels (locked until you answer circuit questions)
6. **🧱 Platforms** - Walk on these
7. **🪜 Ladders** - Climb up/down

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move and climb
- **Space**: Jump
- **P**: Pause game
- **Mouse/Touch**: Use virtual joystick or on-screen buttons

### Game Rules
1. Start with **4 robots** (lives)
2. Start each level with **100 energy** that drains over time
3. Lose a robot if:
   - Energy reaches 0
   - You touch a fireball without invulnerability
   - You fall off the bottom of the screen
4. Complete levels by reaching the **green door**
5. Answer circuit questions to unlock doors
6. Collect all power pills for bonus

### Scoring
- Power pills: +10 points each
- Rings: +100 points each
- Destroy fireballs: +500 points each
- Correct circuit answers: +500 points
- Level completion: +100 points per energy unit remaining

### Circuit Questions
Questions are based on **Bloom's Taxonomy**:
1. **Remembering** - Basic facts (Levels 1-4)
2. **Understanding** - Concept explanations (Levels 5-8)
3. **Applying** - Formula use (Levels 9-12)
4. **Analyzing** - Relationship interpretation (Levels 13-16)
5. **Evaluating** - Judgment and design (Levels 17-22)
